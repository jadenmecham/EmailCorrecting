# EmailCorrecting
For Red Butte Garden IT. Takes email list from Altru and flags potential spelling errors in the domain or username. It checks a user's email from a given .csv file against a list of common email domains and detects typos in the username based on the user's actual name. 

***typos.command*** is the email correction program. It runs in terminal/command prompt after opening it. It is in python and can be edited in an IDE like normal. ***fake emails.csv*** is a recreation of an Altru export using fake email accounts with typos on purpose for testing.
