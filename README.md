# EmailCorrecting
For Red Butte Garden IT. Takes email list from Altru and flags potential spelling errors in the domain or username. It checks a user's email from a given .csv file against a list of common email domains and detects typos in the username based on the user's actual name. 

***app.command*** is the email correcting app programmed using the tkinter library. ***typos.command*** is a simpler version of the program that runs in terminal/command prompt after opening it. ***fake emails.csv*** is a recreation of an Altru export using fake email accounts with typos on purpose for testing.
